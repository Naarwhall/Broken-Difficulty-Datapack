# Evolved-Difficulty-Datapack
Made by Naarwhall

Minecraft is too easy, so I made a datapack to fix that. This datapack adds many more features to minecraft from Custom Bosses to global events that happen randomly. This datapack is made to make you rage and is not for the fain hearted. Do you think you can beat it? [Download](https://github.com/Naarwhall/Evolved-Difficulty-Datapack/releases)

# Features
Features added by the datapack can be found here [>features](https://github.com/Naarwhall/Evolved-Difficulty-Datapack/blob/main/Features.md). However, I suggest figuring out the changes made yourself before looking at the list for the best experience!

# Crafting Recipes
New Crafting Recipes have also been added! [To Crafting Recipes Page](https://github.com/Naarwhall/Broken-Difficulty-Datapack/blob/dc9f3a475a33a67d4a23f0bca9b4a1d95fef5c38/Crafting%20Recipes.md)






# Credits
This Datapack was inspired by Fundy and Mysticat and was made possible with lots of help from the Minecraft Commands Discord.
